      A new model for the initial conditions of heavy-ion collisions.
      The name is an homage to Trento, Italy,
      where my fellow Duke student Scott Moreland and I formulated the idea
      (it also stands for <i>Reduced Thickness Event-by-event Nuclear Topology</i>).

#     Collection of tools for analyzing model simulation data.
#     My idea is to have the heavy-ion physics community contribute to and use
#     this package for common analysis tasks.
#     While it has not taken off, I regularly use it for data analysis in my research.

    description: >
      My poster for Quark Matter 2015, the preeminent conference in heavy-ion physics.
      Presents an analysis similar to my first study but with more parameters
      and improved physics models, including our initial condition model
      T<sub>R</sub>ENTo.
      We'll publish a paper based on this work in spring 2016.

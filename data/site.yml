      Model for the initial conditions of heavy-ion collisions.
      The name is an homage to Trento, Italy,
      where my fellow Duke student Scott Moreland and I formulated the idea
      (it also stands for <i>Reduced Thickness Event-by-event Nuclear Topology</i>).

      Implementation of free-streaming for the &quot;pre-equilibrium&quot; stage
      of the collision, after the initial condition but before quark-gluon plasma
      formation.

    description: >
      Collection of tools for analyzing model simulation data.
      My idea is to have the heavy-ion physics community contribute to and use
      this package for common analysis tasks.
      While it has not taken off, I regularly use it for data analysis in my research.
